    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository hosts the analysis of the Cornell Movie Dialogs dataset for a Natural Language Processing course project at Politecnico di Milano (Polimi). This project aims to leverage various NLP techniques to explore and model movie script dialogues, enabling a deeper understanding of conversational dynamics in films. This README outlines the dataset details, analysis methods, and insights gained from modeling efforts.\n",
